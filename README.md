### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Spring 2024

+ Projec title: The Differences of the Causes of Happiness Between Female and Male
+ This project is conducted by Jingqi Wang

+ Project summary: This project delved into analyzing the causes and categories of happiness among individuals, focusing on differences between genders and marital statuses. Utilizing data from HappyDB: a happiness database of 100,000 happy moments (https://megagon.ai/happydb-a-happiness-database-of-100000-happy-moments/), it identified key themes and patterns in what brings joy to men and women, both when single and after marriage.
 
+ There are 3 questions involved in this project:
  1. What are the differences of the causes of happiness between female and male in general? Do female and male feel happy about the same things?
  2. What makes men and women happy when they are single? What makes men and women happy after marrige? Do 'happy moments' vary?
  3. What are the top predicted categories of 'Happy Moments' for both women and men, and how do they differ between the two genders? What insights do these differences provide?

+ The project concludes that happiness is a complex, multifaceted concept influenced by individual life circumstances, with gender and marital status playing significant roles in shaping the sources of joy. This understanding of happiness shows the need for recognizing and catering to diverse happiness drivers across different life stages and societal segments.
